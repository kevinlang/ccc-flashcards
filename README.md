# A Course in Contemporary Chinese Pleco Flashcards

Books 1-5 are from this [thread](https://www.plecoforums.com/threads/flashcards-for-a-course-in-contemporary-chinese.6100/).

This repository adds the flashcards for the final book.

These are mostly sourced from the [official website](http://mtc.ntnu.edu.tw/chinese-resource.htm). However, these slides have some transcription errors, which have been manually fixed up.
